#TODO
# - figure out how to make copy-paste work

#
# The below lines are just copied from the above medium link. Will look more into later.
#
# remap prefix from 'C-b' to 'C-a'
unbind C-b
set-option -g prefix C-a
bind-key C-a send-prefix

# Start window numbering at 1
set -g base-index 1

# force a reload of the config file
 unbind r
 bind r source-file ~/.tmux.conf

## quick pane cycling
# unbind ^A
# bind ^A select-pane -t :.+
#

#this should let scrolling work?
set -g mode-mouse on
#another option. seems to work a little differently and scrolls less natively to tmux
#set -g terminal-overrides 'xterm*:smcup@:rmcup@'
